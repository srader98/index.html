        <h1>Reflection</h1>
        <p>I choose to read all four of these stories as I was captivated by the storytelling. I was surprised to see the mixes of different types of visual <br>media, like illustration, video and photography. I felt like the blend of all these helped ground the story back in reality. Illustration can be a <br>powerful tool for multiple narratives, if can simple put so many contexts on one page, the text and the dialogue also with seeing the <br>expressions and environment to represent what is happening at the time, similar to that like film. Which is why I tend to lean towards <br>comics and manga for my main form of reading as I enjoy how much can be said on a single page just by the visuals alone. 

<br>Visually, the illustrations vary from photographs since at least in these comics the photographs were used in a nonfiction, documentary-<br>sense to represent the real environments and people these stories were based on. While the illustrations are able to capture the tension, <br>mood and atmosphere through different angles, colors and pacing of each panel. </p>
