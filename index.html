    <p>For both images I wanted to create a sense of vacancy and loneliness. <br>With image one, I took the photo with the idea of a using the <br>diagonal staircase for composition. I went with a warm, darker <br>platters adding a bit of noise to create a vintage look. Using the <br>exposure effect and playing with a slight offset. This on top of <br>changing the color with hue and saturation as well as fixing the shadows and highlights with the curves tool.</p>
        <h2>#2</h2>
            <img src="https://srader98.github.io/index.html/image/image2.jpg" width="500" alt="Image2">

    <p>Again with both images I wanted the theme of vacancy and loneliness. <br>This sense a stillness that will eventually be filled. With Image 2, I <br>did my best to follow the rule of thirds and keep my main subject in <br>the lower right corners. I focuses a more cooler overall color while <br>highlighting the single red seat in the middle of the image. <br>With that I used the color balance and vibrance tools respectively. I used the exposure to empathize the shadows in the image.</p>
